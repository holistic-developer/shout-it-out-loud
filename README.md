# Shout it out loud!

[This rockstar program](./shout_it_out_loud.rock) turns all lower case letters of your input into upper case letters.

It is proof that I am indeed a "Rockstar developer".

# Run it!
**[Run it in your browser](https://codewithrockstar.com/online?source=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holistic-developer/shout-it-out-loud/main/shout_it_out_loud.rock)**

or compile/transpile/interpret the code with one of the tools recommended at [rockstar implementations](https://codewithrockstar.com/code).

# What's going on?
See the the [minimalist](./shout_it_out_loud_minimalist.rock) version explaining the program.
The idiomatic version just uses other variable names and some command aliases.

This program builds a mapping table for all lower case characters and their respective upper case characters.
It then checks for every element of the input if a mapping could be found and if so, it uses this mapping value in the output.

See all rockstar language features in the [docs](https://codewithrockstar.com/docs).
